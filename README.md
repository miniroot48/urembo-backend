## Database Migration from Supabase

This NestJS application was created by analyzing the existing Supabase application and migrating the database schema and business logic. The migration includes:

1. **Schema Migration**: All tables, relationships, and constraints from Supabase
2. **Business Logic**: Core functionality from Supabase Edge Functions
3. **Authentication**: JWT-based auth replacing Supabase Auth
4. **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints matching Supabase API patterns

## Key Differences from Supabase

1. **Authentication**: Uses JWT instead of Supabase Auth
2. **Database Access**: Prisma ORM instead of direct Supabase client
3. **Serverless Functions**: NestJS controllers instead of Edge Functions
4. **Real-time**: No built-in real-time subscriptions (can be added with WebSockets)
5. **Storage**: No built-in file storage (can be integrated with AWS S3, etc.)

## Development

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### Database Management
```bash
# View database in Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio

# Reset database
npx prisma migrate reset

# Deploy migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Testing
```bash

npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Test coverage
npm run test:cov
```

## Production Deployment

1. **Environment Setup**: Configure production environment variables
2. **Database**: Set up production PostgreSQL database
3. **Migrations**: Run `npx prisma migrate deploy`
4. **Build**: `npm run build`
